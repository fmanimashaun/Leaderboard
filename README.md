# Leaderboard

## Overview

The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external [Leaderboard API service](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3). In this activity, the JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app was set up using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. The first working version of the app was developed following a [wireframe provided](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/leaderboard/m1_basic_structure.md). while in the later versions, the Leaderboard API will be consumed using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.

## Project Objectives

- [ ] Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout) using the wireframe below as a guide:
